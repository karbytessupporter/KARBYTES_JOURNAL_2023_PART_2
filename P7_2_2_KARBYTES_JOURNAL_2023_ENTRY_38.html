<p>Perhaps in the future, I will create an artificial intelligence (AI) program which is connected to a web page user interface which runs Python, JavaScript, or some other kind of code to define the AI functions used to return arbitrarily relevant web pages within my &#8220;empire&#8221; of personal websites (the websites named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) in response to user-submitted search query terms. That AI would be what I consider to be the best personal assistant I could have in terms of being a docent to my own mind for myself and others. Rather than ask me questions, users of the KARBYTES_SEARCH_TOOL can ask that AI which runs the KARBYTES_SEARCH_TOOL (whether I am dead or alive).</p>
<p>Another &#8220;random&#8221; thought I had today is this: what separates what I consider to be a minimally STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) educated human from one who is not minimally STEM educated is whether or not that human has the ability to correctly solve single-variable calculus problems. That one &#8220;sieve&#8221; to determine whether or not a human has minimal STEM aptitude seems to define a boundary between those who are &#8220;too hand to mouth&#8221; (i.e. in low-level animalistic survival mode) to think relatively &#8220;expensive&#8221; (in terms of cognitive resources) abstract thoughts and those who are sufficiently able to sustain a minimally robust cerebral life to not be so animalistic and hence limited in terms of being able to solve problems, imagine alternate perspectives, generate amusement (rather than strife), and generally not be depressed. I think that, if more human beings mastered calculus through teaching themselves using free or low cost digital course materials and/or attending formal schooling, the world would be a happier place because the average quality of ability to appreciate the beauty of the natural world would increase.</p>
