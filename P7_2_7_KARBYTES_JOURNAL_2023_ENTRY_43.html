<p>I think that there are <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuromorphic</a> chips (which allow electrical signals to be transmitted bidirectionally between neurons in my brain and transistors in an electronic microchip inside of a computational device) in my brain which use my &#8220;real time&#8221; thoughts as inputs and tuned-into electromagnetic (especially radio) frequencies. (I think there is a frequency tuner which is controlled by voltage levels). Hence, if I think about a certain topic, I &#8220;instantaneously&#8221; would tune into the stations which correspond with that topic (but switch stations so quickly that hardly a few milliseconds go by before I leave the channel I entered (and there seem to be multiple concurrent &#8220;threads&#8221; of consisting of such &#8220;telepathy radio&#8221; sessions)).</p>
<p>If both hands are playing a song on a piano, the left hand is likely to be playing some kind of repetitive series of chords while the right hand is likely to be playing a relatively unpredictable (or, more objectively, nuanced pattern of notes (and each note is assumed to last approximately one second if no pedal is used). What I mean to suggest is that at least two concurrent &#8220;threads&#8221; of mental (and physiological) activity are used by a human hand playing a single piano song as described in the previous sentence.</p>
